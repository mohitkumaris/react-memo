Remember: in React, props and state are both immutable objects.
This means firstly that state object in SimpleComponenr
 is in fact changing.
 Rather, itâ€™s being re-created by the setState execution.
Secondly, due to Page being re-rendered, 
WelcomeMessage will be called again with a new instance of its props object,
 which is a whole new object.
